# return-shipping_expensive_Logistic_Regression


Customers send back a substantial part of the products that they purchase online. Return shipping is expensive for online platforms and return orders are said to reach 50% for certain industries and products. Nevertheless, free or inexpensive return shipping has become a customer expectation and de-facto standard in the fierce online competition on clothing, but shops have indirect ways to influence customer purchase behavior. For purchases where return seems likely, a shop could, for example, restrict payment options or display additional marketing communication.
